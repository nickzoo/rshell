( Overview )
rshell is a command line program that executes other programs from input using the fork, execvp, and wait system calls. Modeled after bash, it supports arguments, comments, and the connectors ";", "||", and "&&".

git clone https://github.com/nickzoo/rshell.git
cd rshell
make
bin/rshell

( Bugs )
Some illegal arguments may mysteriously not cause an error and be ignored.
e.g. ls -INVALID_ARGUMENT
This is machine dependent â€“ on my machine, the provided example does cause an error, but on other machines I have tested on, it does not.

The cd command does nothing, and does not print an error.

The login and hostname must not exceed 255 characters.

( Overview )
rshell is a command line program that executes other programs from input using the fork, execvp, and wait system calls. Modeled after bash, it supports arguments, comments, and the connectors ";", "||", and "&&".

( Instructions )
From command line:
git clone https://github.com/nickzoo/rshell.git
cd rshell
make
bin/rshell

( Bugs )
The exit command will work only if the input is exactly "exit". e.g., "ls; exit", "exit;", "exit ", etc. will not be recognized.

Quotation marks are not treated as special characters.
e.g., echo "hello    world" will print: "hello world"
In bash, it would print: hello    world

If you end a line with "||" or "&&", rshell will not prompt for further input like bash. Instead, the trailing connector will be ignored.

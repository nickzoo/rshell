( Overview )
rshell is a command line shell that executes other programs using the fork,
execvp, and wait system calls. Modeled after bash, it supports arguments,
comments, quotation marks (single '' and double ""), the escape character
"\", the connectors ";", "||", and "&&", input redirection via "<", ">", ">>", and piping ("|").

ls is a program that lists files. This version only recognizes the -a, -l,
and -R options.

cp is a program that copies a file. This version only recognizes a -t
option. If -t is passed, the program will time different methods of copying
a file and print the results.

( Bugs: rshell )
The cd command does nothing, and does not print an error.

Special commands like <up> for history, <tab> for auto-complete, and
<CTRL-U> to delete a line do not work.

Ending a line with "|" does not prompt for further input.

( Bugs: ls )
Only two types of files are recognized: regular files and directories.

The year of a file is not displayed when it is more than 6 months old.

( Bugs: cp )
Passing a directory as the destination will cause an error instead of
copying the file into the directory.

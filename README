( Overview )
rshell is a command line program that executes other programs from input using the fork, execvp, and wait system calls. Modeled after bash, it supports arguments, comments, and the connectors ";", "||", and "&&".

( Instructions )
From command line:
git clone https://github.com/nickzoo/rshell.git
cd rshell
make
bin/rshell

( Bugs )
The exit command will work only if the input is exactly "exit". e.g., "ls; exit", "exit;", "exit ", etc. will not be recognized.

If you end a line with "||" or "&&", rshell will not prompt for further input like bash. Instead, the trailing connector will be ignored.

If you end a line with unmatched quotes, rshell will not prompt for further input like bash. Instead, a syntax error message will be printed.

Unlike bash, strings inside quotes will always be treated as a new token.
e.g., echo a"hello" will print ahello in bash but a hello in rshell.
echo"hello" will cause in error in bash but print hello in rshell.

Some illegal arguments may mysteriously not cause an error and be ignored.
e.g. ls -INVALID_ARGUMENT
This is machine dependent â€“ on my machine, the provided example does cause an error, but on other machines I have tested on, it does not.

The cd command does nothing, and does not print an error.

The login and hostname must not exceed 255 characters.
